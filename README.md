# TetrisJS

A JavaScript implementation of Tetris, using pixi.js and keypress.js.

## Goals

* Use JavaScript for the first time since 2014.
* Use ES6 modules, classes, and other newer features.
* Learn JavaScript testing (without using Node.js, which the project did not require -- See [TestRunner.html][1]).
* Decide if JavaScript is still awful.
